# Feature Specification: SGR Deep Research Agent System Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-sgr-depresearch`
**Created**: 2025-01-21
**Status**: Enhancement/Refactoring
**Input**: User description: "SGR DepResearch агент, имеет апи, кли, батч режим через префект. Пидантик схемы"

## Current Implementation Status
```
✅ EXISTING: CLI interface with interactive and command modes
✅ EXISTING: FastAPI REST API with OpenAI-compatible endpoints
✅ EXISTING: Multiple agent types (sgr, sgr-tools, sgr-auto-tools, etc.)
✅ EXISTING: Batch processing via Prefect flows
✅ EXISTING: Pydantic schemas for data validation
✅ EXISTING: Streaming responses and agent state management

🔄 ENHANCEMENT AREAS: Error handling, monitoring, performance optimization
🔄 ENHANCEMENT AREAS: Extended API functionality and documentation
🔄 ENHANCEMENT AREAS: Advanced batch processing features
```

## Enhancement Execution Flow
```
1. Analyze existing codebase architecture
   → Identified: CLI (cli.py), API (api/endpoints.py), agents, batch flows
2. Review current capabilities and limitations
   → CLI: Rich interface with interactive mode, deep research levels
   → API: OpenAI-compatible with streaming, agent management
   → Batch: Prefect-based parallel processing with result aggregation
3. Identify enhancement opportunities
   → Performance monitoring and metrics
   → Advanced error handling and recovery
   → Extended API endpoints for batch management
   → Improved configuration management
4. Define enhancement priorities based on user value
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary Enhancement Stories
1. **Enhanced Error Recovery**: When research fails due to external service issues, the system should automatically retry with exponential backoff and provide detailed error reporting
2. **Advanced Batch Management**: Users need better control over batch processing including pause/resume, priority queuing, and progress monitoring
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Researchers require detailed metrics about research quality, cost tracking, and performance optimization insights
4. **Configuration Flexibility**: System administrators need easier configuration management for different deployment environments

### Current Acceptance Scenarios (Already Working)
1. **Given** a user has a research question, **When** they submit it via CLI `uv run python -m sgr_deep_research.cli "query"`, **Then** system provides comprehensive research report
2. **Given** a developer sends API request, **When** they use `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint, **Then** they receive streaming research results
3. **Given** a user runs batch command, **When** they execute `uv run python -m sgr_deep_research.cli batch "topic"`, **Then** system processes multiple queries in parallel

### Enhancement Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an external service is temporarily unavailable, **When** research is in progress, **Then** system retries intelligently and continues processing
2. **Given** a batch job is running, **When** user wants to monitor progress, **Then** system provides real-time status updates via API
3. **Given** system is under heavy load, **When** multiple users submit requests, **Then** performance remains stable with proper resource management

### Edge Cases
- How does system handle network timeouts during deep research sessions?
- What happens when Prefect worker nodes fail during batch processing?
- How does API handle rate limiting from external research sources?
- What occurs when configuration files are corrupted or missing?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
