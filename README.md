## 📖 Description

Production-ready open-source system for automated research using Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR). Features real-time streaming responses, OpenAI-compatible API, and comprehensive research capabilities with agent interruption support.

SGR Deep Research is an agent-driven research system with a chat interface. It can run with small LLMs for a fully local mode.

This project is developed by the **neuraldeep** community. It is inspired by the Schema-Guided Reasoning (SGR) work and [SGR Agent Demo](https://abdullin.com/schema-guided-reasoning/demo) delivered by "LLM Under the Hood" community and AI R&D Hub of [TIMETOACT GROUP Österreich](https://www.timetoact-group.at)
